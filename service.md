## Web Sites For Business Owners

In simple terms, there are four main components to the website you are seeing on your computer: website files, a web browser, hosting, and domain name. This document will put these into simple terms for a non-technical audience.

### 1 Website Files

A website is a collection of computer files that describe what you see. Just like how a Word Document computer file describes things like essays or flyers. Construction of website computer files is not easy. It requires advanced technical knowledge of many website technologies and programming languages. This is the "hard part," and is the service we are providing.

### 2 The Web Browser

The web browser is a computer program that displays a Website Files (1) to humans (that's you). In a way, it is the translator from the cryptic Website Files (1) to your computer screen. There are many of these programs. Popular ones include Internet Explore(IE), Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox.

### 3 Hosting

Hosting is a public shoebox to store Website Files (1) in. It is necessary to have one for everyone to access your Website Files (1) and view them with their Web Browser (2). Just like how you put pictures in a photo album to show your family, you put Website Files in Hosting to show the world your website.

### 4 Domain Name

The domain name is the label on your Hosting (3) shoe box. It allows people to find your website from their Web Browser (2). You have undoubtably run into many Domain Names. google.com, yahoo.com, facebook.com are all examples of a Domain Name. Most people choose a Domain Name that is similar to their business name.

### What We Provide

We provide the specialized Website Files described in (1), creating a small business website: standard 5-page static websites. Static meaning that the content text does not change often. After a template is created, business text, pictures, and content is placed within it. Once done we put it on the Hosting (3) purchased by the business / person.

### What You Need

You need to get Hosting (3), and a Domain Name (4). A virtual shoebox with a name. Luckily these are cheap (around 5$ /mo for both). The preferred hosting / domain company is HostGator (hostgator.com). They provide very cheap and easy plans. You will sign up for a plan with a domain name on your own and provide us access to your control panel. We can set up the rest from there. The browser (2) is already covered by your visitors.
